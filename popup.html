    In this blog, we will explore a method used by attackers to bypass scanners and send malicious files, even on
    platforms like Google, such as Gmail.

    File smuggling is a technique that allows users to bypass restrictions on certain file types, such as those blocked
    by corporate proxies. It involves disguising the prohibited file within a different, permitted format, allowing it
    to pass through security filters undetected.

    For example, if a company blocks .exe downloads, file smuggling can be used to embed the .exe within a seemingly
    harmless image file. Once downloaded, the user can then extract the .exe and access the previously restricted
    content.
    File Smuggling Builder
    This is a self-contained HTML app, handy, supports Windows, Mac, Linux and mobile.
    It adopts HTML smuggling technique, leverages HTML5 and JavaScript to embed encoded file into HTML file, when user
    runs the JavaScript code in browser, it decodes the embedded payload, which, in turn, assembles the target file on
    the destination device.
    You can convert your file to HTML encoded format, with password protected, then use it as email attachment or file
    download from web.
    How To Use HTML Smuggling Builder
    Here is the simple steps that you need to follow:
    1. Choose the target file putty.exe, then generate putty.exe.html
    1b. Open putty.exe.html, then retrieve putty.exe
    Download putty.exe.html from this repository (password is password) or try it online
    2a. Choose the target file Sample Document.docx, then generate Sample Document.docx.html
    Download sample Document.docx.html from this repository (password is password) or try it online
    Now you have the final file and this can be attached to email for further attack on the victim's system.</p>
